# 🌱 Node Farm - Dynamic Fruit & Item Display 🧀🥕🌽🥦🥑

Welcome to **Node Farm**, my very first Node.js project! 🚀 This project dynamically displays fruits and items using data from a JSON file, making it a fun and interactive way to explore the power of **Node.js**, **routing**, and **server-side rendering**.

## 📌 Features  
✅ Dynamic product listing from a JSON file  
✅ Individual product details page  
✅ Simple and efficient Node.js server (without Express)  
✅ Beginner-friendly code structure  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Node.js** (for handling server requests and responses)  
- **JavaScript** (for logic and data processing)  
- **JSON** (for storing product details)  
- **HTML & CSS** (for frontend display)  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-farm.git
cd node-farm
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
(No dependencies required for this project! 🎉 Just ensure **Node.js** is installed.)  

### 3️⃣ Run the Server  
```sh
node index.js
```
Now, open your browser and visit **`http://localhost:8000`** to see the magic! ✨
